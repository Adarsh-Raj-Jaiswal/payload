# Payload UI Example

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) front-end made explicitly for the [Payload UI Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/ui). This example demonstrates how to consume Payload's UI library in any React application outside the context of the Admin Panel.

## Getting Started

### Next.js

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory and run `pnpm i --ignore-workspace`\*, `yarn`, or `npm install`
   > \*If you are running using pnpm within the Payload Monorepo, the `--ignore-workspace` flag is needed so that pnpm generates a lockfile in this example's directory despite the fact that one exists in root.
3. `pnpm dev`, `yarn dev`, or `npm run dev` to start the server
4. `open http://localhost:3000` to see the result
